# Examples

This directory contains the smallest public examples for the `ember` workspace.

## `hello-worker`

A minimal HTTP worker showing:

- `wasi:http` entrypoint setup
- routing through `ember-sdk::http::Router`
- middleware usage
- request body and header access

## `sqlite-worker`

A minimal SQLite-backed worker showing:

- schema initialization through `ember-sdk::sqlite::migrations`
- typed SQLite reads
- state mutation through simple HTTP handlers

## `secret-worker`

A minimal secret-backed worker showing:

- environment-backed secret injection
- direct `wasi:http` request handling without extra framework code
- how to read platform-provided secrets at runtime

## `pocket-tasks-worker`

A fuller SQLite-backed worker showing:

- CRUD routes through `ember-sdk::http::Router`
- request body parsing and JSON responses
- persistent task storage on the built-in SQLite host API
- a realistic API shape that can back a small frontend
